## Directions to start a book (after downloading packages described)

1. Open R Studio
2. File - New Project - New Directory - New Book Project 
3. Save where you think it should be.
4. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.
5. If you have errors when trying to compile the book, go to the debug website provided in your warnings.


## Structure of book
* There will be multiple Rmd (R Markdown) files - one for each chapter.
* File naming: 
  + index.Rmd
  + 01-yourchapter1title.Rmd
  + 02-yourchapter2title.Rmd  
* Each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

## Publishing the book to share with others
* See https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/github.html for how to publish book
  * All html output and source files (CSS, images, javascript) need to be in the docs folder.
    * Option A: Add a "docs" folder to the folder all your Rmd files are in, then in your _bookdown.yml file, add the line output_dir: "docs"
    * Option B: Change the directory "_book" to "docs"
  * Also add a .nojekyll fill to your docs folder 
* To compile your book:
  * Option A: Use the "Build" tab (next to Environment and History) and click "Build Book"
  * Option B: Create a .R file and use the command "render_book" to render your book (see RunBook.R) in my GitHub.
* Connect your book project to GitHub if you haven't already.
* Add all files to GitHub.
* In your GitHub repo, go to Settings, GitHub Pages, change Source to master/ and /docs
* Your shareable link is displayed under GitHub Pages!

## Other tips
If your book is not running and your error message is to do with latex: 
* In your _output.yml file: delete 
"bookdown::pdf_book:
  includes:
    in_header: preamble.tex
  latex_engine: xelatex
  citation_package: natbib
  keep_tex: yes" and replace the 
"bookdown::epub: default" with
"bookdown::html_document2: default"
* In your index.Rmd file, add "always_allow_html: yes" to the options at the top
* epub: kindle books, probably don't need this
* default: if you don't specify in "render_book" it will create your default
